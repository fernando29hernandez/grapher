## Technologies
I used `html`, `css`,  `tailwind`, `flowbite`,  `axios`,  `reactjs`,  `dot`,  `graphviz`,  `codemirror.js`

## Setup and run
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `rpm run dev`

## Approach
I hope to be of help to someone who has difficulty understanding how to graphically generate the most well-known data structures.

## Status
Grapher is still in progress. `Version 2` will be adding other types of data structures as B trees or Hash Tables.
